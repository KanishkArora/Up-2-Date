It is an android application which displays world-wide realtime news. It is created using the logics of networking as in JSON parsing.
Various APIs are used for the completion of the app.
The most common thing about news app I have seen is that many a times they are clustered with stuff, messy and dull so I invested a modern UI to the app 
with a good color palette and also a theme switch I often find missing in other news apps. 
Some of the features are still dummy in the app but I will make them fucntional overtime. 
I also used a liquid pager screen to give an overview of the look in an intriguing manner.
There is a category section in which some of the news topics are categorized so that the user easily find the specific news they want to read.
Topics categorized:
1. Business
2. Sports
3. Technology
4. Entertainment
5. Lifestyle
6. Health
